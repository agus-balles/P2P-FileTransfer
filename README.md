# P2P-FileTransfer
Pseudo finished proyect i made a while ago to share files directly with my friend

As this was one of my first "big" proyects the code is cery messy and there may be various bugs and versions

Ps: i started implementing a simple rar password encryption but didnt finished as im busy with school

For the port forwarding i used a modified version of gryphius proyect:
